    <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a junior CS student at Huazhong University of S&T (HUST, China). I'll
      join UCSB in Aug. 2022 as an exchange student. So far, I've finished 115.8
      undergraduate credits in my major and earned a GPA of 3.96/4 (92.2/100,
      Top 7 of 253 students). I've won twice National Scholarship in 2020 and
      2021, which is the HIGHEST honor for undergraduates in China. Also, I've
      been on HUST Outstanding Undergraduates List (Dean's List) since my first
      year at HUST, which is the HIGHEST honor for undergraduates at HUST.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have extensive interests and solid skills in Computer Science. On the
      one hand, I started working on Machine Learning research in Nov. 2020,
      mainly focusing on efficient and robust machine learning algorithms.
      Currently, I'm doing an undergraduate research internship at Rice-EIC Lab.
      Previously, I'm a RA at HUST Big Data Intelligence Lab, focusing on model
      robustness towards backdoor attacks and published a paper in Sept. 2021.
      On the other hand, I'm skilled in software programming including C, C++,
      Python, Java, and many other languages. Since I have taken many courses
      regarding system security, I am especially aware of the vulnerabilities in
      a system. Currently, I'm working at Lenovo developing a smart park system
      with my group.

      I also have experience in leading a team. I was the president of our
      Student Union and started a non-profit student organization, aimed to help
      students do better at school. I directly led a team of 9 people,
      identifying the difficulties that students encounter in their studies and
      developing software and holding lectures to solve them. In order to be
      self-sustainable, we've also done a lot in attracting sponsorship. Thanks
      to our sparks and dedication, we were awarded the Top-Ten-SU title for the
      first time.
    </p>

    <p>
      My wide range of interests beyond computer science allows me to develop
      software and solve problems in different areas. I love photography and
      video editing. In high school, I was awarded the best post-production
      award for the microfilm I worked on. I am also very talented in music, I
      love classical music and I can play piano, French horn and other
      instruments. I also love sports, including basketball, badminton and
      skiing. Although I cannot reach a high level currently, I just enjoy the
      time with my friends.
